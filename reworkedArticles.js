The game offers a wide array of interactive possibilities, such as hunting wildlife and navigating through various terrains. What sets it apart is its ability to remain engaging and captivating even after hours of play, making it a standout among its competitors.\n\n2. Baldur's Gate 3 by Larian Studios is a perfect companion to this year's Dungeons & Dragons film. The game brings together a diverse group of adventurers with their own flaws and quirks and immerses them in a world where the outcome of every decision is determined by the roll of a dice. The writing is solid and the gameplay is incredibly engaging.\n\n3. Dave the Diver by Mintrocket is a game with two distinct halves. In the first half, players dive into the ocean to hunt for seafood while avoiding dangerous obstacles. In the second half, they take on the role of managing a sushi restaurant and selling the seafood they caught earlier. The game is filled with complications and is highly addictive.\n\n4. Videoverse by Kinmoku is a visual novel that explores the emotional impact when a virtual world is shut down. It tells the story of a young person who finds solace and community in the game, only to face immense loss when it is taken away. The game serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of forming connections on commercial platforms.\n\n5.

The convention's website recently displayed a message stating that after more than two decades of E3, it is time to say goodbye and thanked everyone for the memories. E3, also known as \"video game Christmas,\" began in 1995 in Los Angeles. The cancellation of the event in 2020 and 2022, as well as the shift to an online-only event in 2021, was due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which organized the event, had initially planned for an in-person E3 in 2023 but ultimately decided to cancel the event and not offer an online alternative. Over the years, more and more gaming companies have opted to stream their own events for major announcements, leading to a decline in E3's popularity. Companies like Nintendo and Sony have already chosen to broadcast their own keynotes or share news about their consoles outside of E3. This shift reflects the industry's move towards online downloads rather than in-person purchases of video games. The ESA's president and CEO, Stanley Pierre-Louis, explained that it is the right decision to cancel E3 given the new opportunities that exist to engage fans and partners through individual showcases. The convention attempted to revive interest in 2017 by inviting the public to attend, but its final in-person iteration in 2019 saw around 66,000 attendees. Prior to that, only individuals with a demonstrated connection to the video game industry were allowed to attend, creating an exclusive atmosphere.","createdAt":"2023-12-12T18:59:46Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/2885014/pexels-photo-2885014.jpeg"},{"title":"Building blocks of a new metaverse: Lego Fortnite is a delight to play","topic":"games","author":"Julia M Cameron","body":"A new game mode called Lego Fortnite has been launched within the popular game Fortnite, combining elements of Lego, Fortnite, and Minecraft.

In this game, a group of teenagers must overthrow a tyrannical monarch by joining forces with local resistance fighters in a fantastical kingdom. The battles take place in various urban and underground settings, where players can use melee, projectile, and magical attacks to defeat enemies. The game incorporates elements of urban warfare, psychiatry, and anime aesthetics to create a unique experience. However, it is important to note that there is a significant amount of dialogue and voice acting to navigate through before players can fully immerse themselves in the combat. Persona 5 Tactica offers some innovative features, such as gaining an additional turn when knocking down an opponent, but it faces stiff competition from other turn-based tactics games. Despite its incentives for perfecting strategies and completing stages efficiently, the game's lengthy tutorials, lackluster storyline, basic environments, and low difficulty may limit its appeal to only hardcore fans of the series.","createdAt":"2023-12-02T13:00:46Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/707837/pexels-photo-707837.jpeg"},{"title":"SteamWorld Build review – tinker with a tiny township full of robots in hats","topic":"games","author":"Gustavo Fring","body":"The latest installment in the SteamWorld series is a charming and quirky game that combines elements of city-building and dungeon-crawling.

Upon her return, she encounters her middle-school ex, Sergio, who challenges her to a fight in an attempt to win her back. In the game \"Thirsty Suitors,\" Jala fights her exes in combat as a means of addressing their unresolved feelings. The combat is turn-based, requiring players to complete timed button-presses to attack or defend themselves. Jala and her opponents engage in conversation during the battles, using both words and fists to work through their emotions. Each opponent has different vulnerabilities and it is up to the player to determine how to approach them. The battles can feel repetitive as they drag on, but the combat mechanics offer an interesting take on resolving conflicts. Outside of battles, Jala gets around on her skateboard, which plays a significant role in the game and includes optional trick challenges. Despite its silliness, \"Thirsty Suitors\" tackles various themes such as rural exodus, coming out as queer, and the challenges faced by south Asian immigrants.

The game is played on a four-by-four grid with 16 colored tiles. Players can swipe on any row or column, moving the entire sequence up, down, left, or right. The grid is wraparound, meaning that tiles will reappear on the opposite edge if pushed off. The objective is to maneuver the tiles until three-of-a-kind are matched, causing them to disappear from the grid and be replaced from the top.\n\nWhile the concept seems straightforward, Finity adds a twist - tiles can only be moved a certain number of times before locking into place, preventing their row or column from moving until cleared. Players who make frivolous moves will quickly find themselves trapped. With each move, the possibilities narrow until patterns become immovable, resembling prison bars. The phone even provides haptic feedback when attempting to move a locked line, intensifying the feeling of failure.\n\nAs players progress through Finity, the game reveals itself as a thoughtful and strategic experience, reminiscent of chess. It requires foresight to anticipate not only the next move but also the three moves that follow. Players have ample time to ponder their decisions, unless they opt for tempo mode. In tempo mode, moves are synchronized with a driving musical track, creating a meditative and trance-like atmosphere. The combination of haptics, audio, and visuals in Finity form a mesmerizing cognitive task that is both soothing and challenging.","createdAt":"2023-10-14T12:00:41Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/669276/pexels-photo-669276.jpeg"},{"title":"Forza Motorsport review – an icy, luxuriant driving sim that honours raw V8 power","topic":"games","author":"Kevin Bidwell","body":"In 2023, Turn 10, the studio behind the Forza Motorsport franchise, found themselves in a dilemma.

After a six-year hiatus, Turn 10 finally released a new Forza Motorsport game, but it remains true to its roots as a more traditional driving simulator, without incorporating the casual-friendly features of Forza Horizon. \n\nForza Motorsport immerses players in a world of luxury and power, featuring 500 different cars to choose from. The game emphasizes the importance of optimization, both on the road and in the garage. Precise steering and handling are crucial to success, and players have access to a wide range of parts and accessories to enhance their vehicles. Optimization is key, whether it's adjusting tire pressure for specific conditions or meticulously fine-tuning a car for maximum performance.\n\nHowever, Turn 10 also provides options for those who prefer a more simplified experience. Players can choose to let the game automatically upgrade their vehicles after races, eliminating the need for deep customization. Forza Motorsport is designed to appeal to both hardcore racing simulation enthusiasts and newcomers to the genre, offering a loot grind-like system where players can collect and upgrade various car parts.\n\nMultiplayer features allow players to compete in casual or intense races with other players from around the world. However, the game also caters to solo players, providing a satisfying experience through repeated practice and improvement.\n\nOverall, Forza Motorsport remains true to its roots as a traditional racing simulator, offering a deep and satisfying experience for both solo and multiplayer players.

With its pixelated art style reminiscent of Super Nintendo classics, Sea of Stars immerses players in a world filled with dense, fantastical storytelling. The game follows two teenage heroes, Zale and Valere, and their charismatic friend Garl, as they embark on a journey filled with surprises and emotional moments.\n\nThe writing in Sea of Stars flourishes after a slightly slow start, with bright and natural dialogue that enhances the storytelling and narrative design. The game introduces a diverse cast of characters, each with their own emotional arcs that flow naturally. While some quests may feel like tedious fetch-quests, the overall enjoyment of exploring the well-designed map compensates for it. The combat system is turn-based and smooth, allowing players to strategically use magic and physical attacks to their advantage. The battles, along with the rhythmic component reminiscent of Super Mario RPG, pay homage to the beloved classics while creating something unique.\n\nThe meticulously crafted maps in Sea of Stars showcase incredible attention to detail, with each area rendered and lit in a visually stunning way. While the game's atmospheric darkness can sometimes overshadow the beauty, the world still feels rich and alive. Exploring the map is a delight, with hidden pathways and areas that invite curiosity and exploration.\n\nIn terms of the audio experience, Sea of Stars stands out with its melodic and nostalgic soundtrack. The battle music, in particular, adds to the excitement and enhances the gameplay. The game's attention to detail, from the music to the visuals, makes it a fantastic choice for gamers looking to spend their evenings immersed in a captivating RPG experience. Sea of Stars goes beyond being a mere homage to classic RPGs and establishes itself as a modern classic in its own right.","createdAt":"2023-08-31T10:54:22Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3593983/pexels-photo-3593983.jpeg"},{"title":"Corgis and cats with crossbows: Party Animals wants to be your new Saturday night video game","topic":"games","author":"cottonbro studio","body":"Recreate Games, the developer behind Party Animals, is set to release a new party brawler featuring adorable pets. The game draws inspiration from the popular beat-'em-up Gang Beasts and allows players to dress up and battle against each other with a variety of weapons. The game features cute and chaotic gameplay scenarios, such as transforming into a corgi and fighting on a submarine or engaging in a brawl in a bar or in the snow. The head of Recreate Games, known as PM, explains that the game was created with the intention of providing a fun and enjoyable experience for both competitive strategy game enthusiasts and fans of stress-relieving titles. The development team poured their love for animals into the game's characters, with some pets from team members' homes even making it into the cast. In addition to battles, Party Animals offers other multiplayer activities, including stealing and playing football, with the goal of providing humorous and funny moments.

It stays true to the original game's formula and draws inspiration from its vibrant culture. In the game, you play as Red, a robotic head attached to the body of a graffiti artist named Faux. The gameplay revolves around performing complex tricks on a skateboard to earn points and create street art. The graphics and soundtrack of the game are reminiscent of the turn of the millennium, with a futuristic hip-hop aesthetic. While the controls have been improved compared to Jet Set Radio, the trick system doesn't offer much room for creativity. Additionally, the game lacks a combat system, making encounters with cops repetitive. However, these flaws are overshadowed by the game's overall vibe and nostalgia. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk captures the essence of 1999 and provides an enjoyable experience for fans of the original game.","createdAt":"2023-08-24T13:42:10Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/163036/mario-luigi-yoschi-figures-163036.jpeg"},{"title":"New worlds of adventure: the most exciting video games of autumn 2023","topic":"games","author":"Jessica Lewis 🦋 thepaintedsquare","body":"Bethesda, the developer behind Elder Scrolls, has created a massive science-fiction role-playing game that offers players the chance to explore over a thousand planets and a space-station city.

During his time there, he meets Archimedes, a local resident who had invented a weapon to defend the city against the Roman siege. This weapon involved using brass mirrors to focus the sun's rays and set fire to the Roman ships. It is unclear whether this weapon was actually built or if it worked effectively, as modern attempts to recreate it have produced mixed results. However, the concept behind this weapon is now used in the generation of solar power.\n\nSolar power plants use parabolic or flat mirrors that track the movement of the sun. These mirrors focus the sun's rays into a concentrated beam of light, which is then used to heat a solar furnace. This furnace can reach extremely high temperatures and is capable of melting salt. The heat stored in the molten salts is then used to generate electricity, even during nighttime. This addresses one of the criticisms of solar power, which is its perceived inability to function without direct sunlight. By locating solar plants in areas with abundant sunshine, such as the Sahara, the issue of cloudy weather or reduced sunlight during winter can be overcome.","createdAt":"2023-12-27T06:00:02Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4185957/pexels-photo-4185957.jpeg"},{"title":"For the record","topic":"news","author":"Alex Green","body":"We apologize for the incorrect year of birth given for Tina Turner in a previous article.

While roofs are primarily designed to protect buildings from the elements, many can be adapted for greener uses. There are thousands of hectares of roofs that are perfectly suited for solar panels, yet are empty. Solar electricity generation is actually cheaper than fossil fuels. A recent example of this adaptation is at King's College in Cambridge, where the chapel's roof was ideal for generating electricity. If every church in the UK followed this example, it would have a significant impact on the country's climate goals. Additionally, flatter roofs on factories, warehouses, schools, and other buildings can also be used to generate green energy. One simple option is to plant sedums, which are succulent plants with fleshy leaves and flat flowerheads, on lightweight clinker. These plants and clinker provide insulation for the building and help retain rainwater, reducing the risk of urban flooding.","createdAt":"2023-12-22T06:00:47Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/518543/pexels-photo-518543.jpeg"},{"title":"Corrections and clarifications","topic":"news","author":"Suzy Hazelwood","body":"According to a recent article, there was an error in stating that there is a community of Chinese people who are among the most deprived 10% of neighborhoods in the Leamouth peninsula in Tower Hamlets, London.

In Somerset, there are approximately eight hours of daylight, while on the Shetland island of Unst, just below the Arctic Circle, there are less than seven hours. The limited daylight poses a challenge for small birds who need to consume a significant amount of food each day. They must race against time to obtain enough sustenance to maintain their body weight during the longer periods when they are unable to feed. This is why it is crucial for us to feed garden birds in order to ensure their survival.\n\nAside from food availability, small birds also face challenges posed by weather conditions. During cold snaps, particularly those lasting several days and accompanied by heavy snow, the birds must find ways to keep warm at night. One method is huddling together and fluffing up their feathers to retain heat. Even larger species, like starlings, gather in the evenings before roosting. Some speculate that struggling birds may observe and follow healthier and fatter individuals in the morning, as they know where the best food sources are located.","createdAt":"2023-12-21T06:00:19Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3944425/pexels-photo-3944425.jpeg"},{"title":"Corrections and clarifications","topic":"news","author":"alleksana","body":"An article published on November 18th titled \"How to manage as an unpaid carer\" has been corrected to include additional information.

This payout from his TCI hedge fund is half of what he received the previous year. The dividend payment reflects a decline in pre-tax profits at TCI Fund Management. Despite the reduction, the payment is still 8,000 times the average UK salary and around 1,700 times what Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earns. The money was paid to another company controlled by Hohn, which is believed to have been reinvested in the Children’s Investment (TCI). Hohn established TCI in 2003 and has amassed a personal fortune of over $6.2 billion. He has been praised as the UK’s most generous man, having donated a significant amount to charitable causes. However, donations from the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) reduced to £390 million in 2022, as the value of its investment portfolio declined. The TCI hedge fund also made donations of $26 million to CIFF and $52.5 million to Hohn’s new charity, the CH Foundation (UK). Hohn has a reputation for leading a modest lifestyle and is a vocal advocate for charitable giving. His hedge fund, TCI, is headquartered in Mayfair.","createdAt":"2023-12-07T09:16:34Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/243747/pexels-photo-243747.jpeg"},{"title":"Weatherwatch: bees need cosy homes, too","topic":"news","author":"hermaion","body":"New research has revealed that the belief that bees huddling together in thin-walled beehives is beneficial for their health and to control mite infestations is incorrect. It has been discovered that bee huddling is actually a desperate attempt to stay alive. This new understanding challenges the conventional wisdom that thin-walled wooden hives are an accurate representation of bee behavior. Derek Mitchell from the University of Leeds conducted a study to examine heat loss in a bee huddle and determine if it helps keep them warm. Contrary to previous beliefs, Mitchell's results showed that the closer the bees are to each other, the faster heat flows between them. This suggests that huddling behavior is a survival mechanism, as the bees attempt to share warmth and keep themselves above a critical temperature. This new information highlights the need to redesign beehives to provide bees with more insulation and warmth during colder temperatures.","createdAt":"2023-12-07T06:00:01Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/243747/pexels-photo-243747.jpeg"},{"title":"Corrections and clarifications","topic":"news","author":"Ron Lach","body":"A recent editorial incorrectly stated that service exports would need to increase by £120bn to reduce the UK's current account deficit to zero.

This data serves as a crucial indicator of the global campaign against climate change. However, this week's measurements do not provide much cause for optimism, as they reveal a worrisome trend. Currently, the concentration of carbon dioxide is 422.36 parts per million, which is 5.06ppm higher than the same day last year. This increase over the span of 12 months is likely the largest ever recorded, surpassing the average yearly increment of the previous decade. To put this into perspective, exactly ten years ago, the concentration stood at 395.64ppm, at which point, scientists were already concerned about its impact on weather patterns. Now, we are witnessing the catastrophic consequences of passing the 400ppm mark, including extreme heatwaves, storms, droughts, floods, and the alarming rise in sea levels. These figures highlight the failure of the international community, represented by 27 annual meetings of the convention, to effectively address the climate crisis. The situation continues to deteriorate at an increasingly fast pace, with no signs of carbon dioxide levels decreasing or even reaching the \"safe\" threshold of 350ppm.","createdAt":"2023-11-24T06:00:13Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/177557/pexels-photo-177557.jpeg"},{"title":"Corrections and clarifications","topic":"news","author":"cottonbro studio","body":"A painting by LS Lowry titled \"Remarkable\" is expected to be sold for up to £1.5m.

However, they unexpectedly discovered intense flashes of light that lasted for a thousandth of a second. These flashes were known as \"superbolts,\" which are the most powerful form of lightning on Earth. Superbolts are 100 times stronger than typical lightning and have the potential to cause significant damage. \n\nSuperbolts are quite rare, accounting for less than 1% of all lightning occurrences. The root cause of superbolts has remained a mystery for a long time. However, a recent study examining superbolts around the globe has identified three specific regions where they occur most frequently. These regions include the north-east Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the high-altitude Altiplano plateau spanning Peru and Bolivia. \n\nOne common characteristic of these hotspots is that thunderstorms in these areas tend to be relatively compact and lie closer to the sea or land surface. The electrical energy in a lightning bolt is typically generated in the upper, frigid areas of a storm cloud, where temperatures are at or below 0°C. Interestingly, the superbolts hotspots observed had a unique feature in common – the 0°C level in the storm clouds was unusually close to the surface below. \n\nAs a result, when a storm occurred in these areas, the lightning had a shorter distance to travel with less electrical resistance. This allowed for a more powerful current to reach the ground, posing a greater risk for potential damage.","createdAt":"2023-11-23T06:00:50Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/5778404/pexels-photo-5778404.jpeg"},{"title":"Corrections and clarifications","topic":"news","author":"Suzy Hazelwood","body":"According to a recent water quality report by Surfers Against Sewage, the majority of popular inland bathing spots in the UK have been found to be unsafe for swimming.

The study found that birds living within protected areas, primarily nature reserves, are becoming more similar to birds outside of these boundaries. The research was conducted in Canada between 1997 and 2019, a country where rising temperatures are occurring at a faster rate than other places, resulting in numerous weather records being broken during recent summers. The study also revealed that protected areas are crucial in aiding species that typically inhabit more northerly regions, as they help slow their decline. For species like the Lapland longspur, which breeds across Canada, Scandinavia, and Siberia, protected habitats may determine their survival and potential extinction. Conversely, species with more southerly ranges are taking advantage of climate change by expanding their territory northwards. For example, the northern cardinal flourished regardless of whether its habitat was protected. Similarly, adaptable European birds like the wren are also expected to fare well. However, rarer and more specialized species in the northern hemisphere will likely struggle to cope with the accelerating climate crisis.","createdAt":"2023-11-16T06:00:07Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4307715/pexels-photo-4307715.jpeg"},{"title":"Corrections and clarifications","topic":"news","author":"Andrea Piacquadio","body":"The article titled \"North Korea: Munitions ‘shipped to Moscow at scale’ for use in Ukraine, 28 October, p43\" mistakenly used the term \"artillery piece\" instead of \"artillery round.\" The head of the Estonian Defence Forces Intelligence Centre, Col Ants Kiviselg, estimated that the 1,000 sea containers sent to Russia contained a total of 300,000 to 350,000 artillery rounds.

However, having too many wind turbines close together can create economic problems. Researchers have discovered that as the blades of each turbine rotate, they lessen the strength of the wind. This reduction in wind energy can reduce the speed of downwind blades by up to 20% even 50km away. This decline in wind energy can make some windfarm projects financially unviable, especially with rising construction costs and shrinking profit margins. Although some windfarm projects have been postponed, several countries are still moving forward with projects near the boundaries of their exclusive economic zones in order to harness the available winds. Currently, there are no international agreements addressing potential conflicts of interest when these planned windfarms are close to neighboring projects.

The Greenland ice cap, which is 3km thick, is one of the main factors contributing to the current rise of 3.4mm per year. If melted, the ice cap has the potential to raise sea levels by 7 metres. Scientists have determined that the temperature threshold at which Greenland's melting becomes irreversible is between 1.7C and 2.3C above pre-industrial levels. As global temperatures are projected to rise by up to 3C this century, we are dangerously close to reaching this tipping point. While the melting process will be gradual, there is time to move inland. If temperatures were reduced back to 1.5C in the future, the melting would eventually stop.

As a result, the haricot beans used in baked beans are imported from countries with warmer climates like North America, Ethiopia, and China.,However, after 12 years of development at the University of Warwick, the first commercial crop of homegrown haricot beans has recently been harvested on a farm in Lincolnshire. This new variety of bean can be planted in May, when the weather is warm enough, and harvested in September when the weather is still dry. In addition to being able to grow in the UK, these beans are also resistant to diseases.,The cultivation of homegrown haricot beans has several benefits. It can help reduce the need for food imports, decrease carbon dioxide emissions from long-distance transportation, and even lower the use of fertilizers.

The research found that the older generation in certain parts of East Lancashire, particularly around Blackburn, still emphasize the R sound in words like \"car\" and \"bird,\" but younger speakers tend to pronounce it more softly or omit it altogether. This suggests that the accent may vanish completely within a generation or two. The study is significant because it provides the first systematic acoustic analysis of a rhotic accent in present-day England, shedding light on a linguistic feature that has received little attention compared to other regional accents. The disappearance of the Lancashire accent may be happening gradually and going unnoticed by many. It is a part of a larger trend of regional dialects and accents disappearing due to social pressures and cultural influences.

Traditional methods of monitoring volcanoes rely on detecting an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, which can be challenging due to background gas levels and difficult measurement in inaccessible, heavily vegetated areas. To overcome this issue, the researchers investigated whether plant health could be used as a proxy for detecting volcanic activity. By studying satellite images from Yellowstone national park taken over nearly four decades, they found that plants became greener in locations where volcanic activity was building, followed by browning when the activity reached its peak. This change in plant health was attributed to the increase in carbon dioxide aiding plant growth, followed by the effects of sulfur dioxide and high temperatures killing the plants. The results, published in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, indicate that monitoring plant health via satellite images could provide early warning of volcanic activity years in advance. This technique is particularly suitable for monitoring forested areas with broad, conical-shaped stratovolcanoes, such as Mount Etna in Italy or Taal volcano in the Philippines.","createdAt":"2023-12-26T06:00:45Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/954585/pexels-photo-954585.jpeg"},{"title":"Did yule solve it?

With a magnitude of -1.46, Sirius is about half as bright as Jupiter. However, unlike Jupiter, Sirius appears to twinkle because its light is affected by the layers and turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere. This phenomenon is true for all stars, but only the brightest ones twinkle visibly. Planets, on the other hand, appear as steady points of light because they are much closer to Earth and appear as tiny discs, which minimizes the atmospheric effects.,Canis Major was first recorded by Ptolemy in the 2nd century and is believed to be one of Orion's hunting dogs, along with Canis Minor. In the chart provided, the view from London at 0000GMT on 26 December shows Canis Major in the southern celestial hemisphere, below the celestial equator. Although it doesn't rise very high in the northern sky, the bright star of Sirius makes Canis Major easily identifiable.

This triggers signals to the brain that increase the feeling of fullness and decrease hunger. The pill, which is powered by a battery encased in a capsule, would be swallowed before meals and exit the body naturally. The researchers suggest that the cost of the pills, when mass-produced, could be relatively low. They also suggest that future development of the pill could include implants or longer-lasting versions to reduce the need for frequent ingestion.","createdAt":"2023-12-22T19:00:03Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3938023/pexels-photo-3938023.jpeg"},{"title":"Reindeer can multitask and chew while they sleep, study shows","topic":"science","author":"Aleksandar Pasaric","body":"Research suggests that reindeer can sleep while chewing, providing inspiration for individuals who feel exhausted after excessive feasting during Christmas. Reindeer spend their time consuming foliage during the summer, an important activity considering the need to find food during winter. Researchers found that the animals balance digestion and sleep by multitasking. Brain activity data from four female reindeer showed that the average amount of time spent asleep was the same in all seasons. Sleep phases remained steady regardless of the season. Furthermore, when reindeer spent time chewing cud, their sleepiness decreased. The study suggests that the ability to sleep while digesting is crucial during the summer months when reindeer are very active in order to store enough food for winter. \n","createdAt":"2023-12-22T16:00:02Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1694000/pexels-photo-1694000.jpeg"},{"title":"How desert shrub’s salty ‘sweat’ collects water from dry air","topic":"science","author":"Anthony 🙂","body":"Researchers have recently discovered a survival mechanism that allows the athel tamarisk plant, found in salty deserts across the Middle East and other regions, to thrive in harsh environments. The plant has the ability to \"sweat\" concentrated salty water through glands on its leaves, leaving behind salt crystals. These crystals serve two purposes: they remove toxic salt waste and help the plant absorb moisture. Some of the crystals simply fall off, but others, specifically lithium sulphate crystals, remain on the leaves and have the surprising ability to swell with water at night. This moisture is then absorbed by the leaves, aided by an adhesive surface that holds on to the water. This natural process of harvesting water in arid conditions could potentially inspire environmentally friendly methods of collecting water from the air to combat water scarcity, without the need for excessive energy consumption. Additionally, this discovery may also have implications for improving cloud seeding to promote rainfall.","createdAt":"2023-12-20T06:00:04Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/132477/pexels-photo-132477.jpeg"},{"title":"Taters the cat stars in Nasa’s first video streamed from deep space","topic":"science","author":"Rodolfo Clix","body":"On Monday, an orange tabby named Taters became the first cat to star in a video from space.

The token is believed to have been given by the church to poor people as a form of exchange for food. Found near Oxburgh Hall in Norfolk, the token is believed to have originated from Bury St Edmunds Abbey, almost 30 miles away in Suffolk. One side of the token is quite corroded but would have likely depicted the head of a bishop, while the other side is well preserved, showing a long cross. It is believed that this type of token may have been distributed by a choirboy acting as the \"boy bishop\" during the Christmas season. In medieval and early Tudor times, on the Feast Day of St Nicholas (6 December), cathedrals would choose a choirboy to parody the bishop, leading religious services, processions, and collecting money for the church. Boy bishops would also distribute tokens to the poor, which could be used between St Nicholas Day and Holy Innocents Day on 28 December. The token discovered is made of lead and is the size of a groat, equivalent to four pennies. It is believed that someone from Oxburgh village may have made the trip to Bury St Edmunds to witness the festive ceremonies and acquire the token. This finding highlights the rich cultural life that even the poorest people had during the medieval period. It also highlights the Christmas season as a time of fun and celebration for children, with a child taking on the role of the bishop and St Nicholas as the patron saint of children. The discovery was made as part of a survey of the West Park field at Oxburgh, which has revealed artifacts from both medieval and Roman times. Oxburgh Hall, built in 1482, was a statement of power and prestige by the Bedingfeld family, who faced persecution for their Catholic faith.\n","createdAt":"2023-12-18T19:55:28Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1108812/pexels-photo-1108812.jpeg"},{"title":"Starwatch: moon makes passing encounter with Jupiter","topic":"science","author":"Chokniti Khongchum","body":"This week, the moon will reach nearly fullness and will pass by Jupiter on 21 and 22 December.

Researchers found that DNA inherited from Neanderthals may be responsible for the tendency of some individuals to prefer waking up and going to bed earlier. While most Neanderthal genes have been eradicated through evolution, a small fraction remain in modern humans, potentially due to their ability to help early humans adapt to their new environments when they migrated from Africa to Eurasia. The genes that remain are involved in governing the body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, and increase the likelihood of being a morning person. The researchers analysed DNA from both modern humans and Neanderthals, and found that different genetic variants were responsible for the body clocks of the two groups. The Neanderthal genes are believed to have had a small impact overall, but may have helped our ancestors adapt to life at higher latitudes.

Researchers in the US conducted a study involving over 2,000 participants and found that individuals often overestimate the negative consequences of declining an invitation. Regardless of whether participants were told they were the only person invited or if multiple invitations were given, those declining tended to rate the potential consequences as more severe than hosts. The study also revealed that individuals were less concerned about rejecting an invitation when they had previously experienced their own invitation being declined by someone else. The results have implications for real-life situations and suggest that people could decline more invitations than they currently do.","createdAt":"2023-12-11T14:00:36Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/256381/pexels-photo-256381.jpeg"},{"title":"Can you solve it?

This shocking discovery provides further insight into the lives of enslaved people in ancient Pompeii, who were often overlooked by historical sources despite making up the majority of the population. The bakery, found in the Regio IX area of the Pompeii archaeological park in Italy, was part of a home that was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79. The remains of three victims were found in one of the bakery's rooms, indicating that the home was still occupied at the time of the eruption. Markings on the floor were used to coordinate the movement of enslaved workers and blindfolded animals. The home had a residential area with elaborate frescoes, as well as the bakery where enslaved people were forced to grind grain for bread production. The bakery was isolated from the outside world, with only one exit leading to the main hall of the house. This discovery highlights the brutal nature of ancient slavery, where enslaved people were treated with violence and had their freedom of movement restricted.

Throughout his career, he made significant contributions to the understanding of how bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. One of his most notable achievements was his collaboration with Nobel laureate Arthur Kornberg on bacterial survival at Stanford University in the early 2000s. His research focused on the challenging pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and revealed that standard laboratory tests underestimated its resistance in infected patients. \n\nHowever, Mike's expertise extended beyond pharmacy and microbiology. He also had a deep interest in poetry and philosophy, which he explored in his book titled \"Human Survival\" published in 2018. The book examined the conflict between our evolutionary background and the socially disconnected nature of modern life. \n\nHis career began at Aston University in Birmingham, where he became a professor and the head of the school of pharmacy in 1970. During his time there, he built the school's reputation as a leading research institution by fostering an international perspective and hiring young academics. In addition, Mike played a crucial role in establishing the Martin Luther King Centre at the university, promoting justice and peace through reasoned dialogue among people of all faiths. From 1982 to 1988, he served as the dean of the faculty of science and pro vice-chancellor for postgraduate affairs at Aston, gaining respect for his willingness to speak truthfully about the university's strategic direction.\n\nMike was born in Wallasey, Merseyside, to Joseph Brown, a bookmaker, and Gertrude Auburn, a housewife. He earned his pharmacy degree from the University of Manchester and his PhD from the University of London's school of pharmacy. After completing postdoctoral studies at the University of Florida and spending time at the University of Bath, Mike settled in Birmingham until his retirement in 1997. Even after retiring, he continued to collaborate with colleagues as a professor emeritus.\n\nMike's contributions are evident in his extensive publication record of over 200 papers. However, his impact extends beyond his academic work. He touched the lives of many individuals, including those he mentored and supported.

The study concluded that infants learn languages through rhythmic information, such as nursery rhymes, rather than phonetic information. The researchers recorded the brain activity of 50 infants at different ages and found that phonetic encoding in babies emerges gradually, starting with dental sounds and nasal sounds. The researchers believe that speech rhythm information is crucial to the development of a well-functioning language system and that parents should talk and sing to their babies as much as possible to enhance language outcomes. This study challenges the idea that phonetic information is the key to language learning and suggests that dyslexia and developmental language disorder may be associated with rhythm perception rather than difficulties with processing phonetic information. The study is part of the BabyRhythm project, which is investigating the relationship between language, dyslexia, and developmental language disorder.","createdAt":"2023-12-01T12:32:10Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3769714/pexels-photo-3769714.jpeg"},{"title":"Archaeologists reveal life stories of hundreds of people from medieval Cambridge","topic":"science","author":"Rodolfo Clix","body":"Researchers at Cambridge University have used scientific techniques to uncover the stories of ordinary medieval residents of the city.

This finding raises questions about the planetary movements in our own solar system. The star, located about 100 light years away in the Coma Berenices constellation, is about 20% smaller than our Sun. The planets in this system not only have a different composition from those in our solar system but also appear to have interconnected movements. The team found that the time it takes for one planet to orbit the star is related to the time it takes for the next planet to orbit through a neat ratio. This resonant configuration has been preserved for billions of years. Although this resonance is expected to be common in planetary systems due to gravitational interactions during formation, only about 1% of observed systems show this phenomenon, with even fewer having as many as six planets moving in coordination. The rarity may be due to events such as the formation of massive planets or impacts by meteorites that distort the orbits. The newly discovered planets, referred to as \"sub-Neptunes\", are close to their star with temperatures ranging from 170-650C. They have diameters two to three times that of Earth but smaller than Neptune. The masses and densities of the planets were determined using ground-based measurements. The specific composition of these planets is unknown, but they likely have a solid core surrounded by hydrogen and helium. The discovery of these six sub-Neptunes of varying sizes, temperatures, and masses around the same star provides astronomers with an opportunity to study and understand the differences among such planets without other influencing factors. The initial observations of dips in the star's brightness were made in 2020 by Nasa's Tess satellite. Further data from the European Space Agency's Cheops satellite confirmed the existence of the planets and their organized orbits. The study of this planetary system is published in the journal Nature.","createdAt":"2023-11-29T16:00:23Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3913031/pexels-photo-3913031.jpeg"},{"title":"‘It’s amazing’: scientists analyse 4.6bn-year-old dark dust from Bennu asteroid","topic":"science","author":"Anthony 🙂","body":"Scientists at the Natural History Museum in London have received a small amount of dark dust and granules from an asteroid called Bennu, located 200 million miles away from Earth. The material is 4.6 billion years old, dating back to the beginning of the solar system. The samples were brought back to Earth in September 2020 by NASA's Osiris-Rex mission, which collected over 60g of untouched material from Bennu. Preliminary analysis has revealed that the asteroid contains carbon, water, and organic compounds. Scientists hope to study the samples for years to better understand the formation of the solar system and the role of asteroids in delivering water to Earth. The samples will also be used to study hydrogen isotopes in the water to see if they match those found in Earth's oceans. Additionally, the research will help in understanding how to deflect or destroy asteroids that could potentially harm Earth. The first phase of research will focus on non-destructive tests to learn about Bennu's mineral composition and structure. The Natural History Museum has extensive experience in handling small amounts of precious materials from outer space. The pristine condition of the samples provides a unique opportunity for scientists to study an unaltered asteroid and unlock its secrets.","createdAt":"2023-11-28T00:01:44Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/132477/pexels-photo-132477.jpeg"},{"title":"Doctors encouraged by early-stage trial of MS stem cell therapy","topic":"science","author":"Faik  Akmd","body":"A new therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS) involving the injection of stem cells directly into the brain has been found to be safe and potentially protective against further damage from the disease.

The process of selecting a new council involves the lowest-ranked philosopher proposing a new council and ranking. The council then votes on the proposal, and if a majority approves, it becomes the new council. However, if the proposal is rejected, the lowest-ranked philosopher is removed from the council and the process continues with the next lowest-ranked philosopher making a proposal.\n\nThe goal of each philosopher is to become the philosopher king on the new council. Each philosopher prefers being on the council above all else and will only vote in favor of a council that they are part of. Additionally, they prefer to have a higher rank on the council and prefer a smaller council size.\n\nThe puzzle asks for a proposal that guarantees the lowest-ranked philosopher, philosopher 5, becomes philosopher king. To solve the puzzle, one should think about what happens when the council size is reduced from five philosophers to four, then three, then two, and finally one.\n\nThe solution to the puzzle involves working backwards and considering the consequences of each proposal. The solution does not require any technical knowledge and will be provided in an update later. In the meantime, readers are invited to discuss their favorite stories about pirates.\n\nThe puzzle was written by Professor Joel David Hamkins, an expert in logic from the University of Notre Dame.

However, I often wondered if this was a common experience for most kids. I was always cautious and aware of assumptions made about me as a black kid growing up in east London. My earliest memory is of having a picnic on the UK coast, which was a happy memory. Memories can be fallible, and part of therapy is re-evaluating and reframing memories based on new information. I grew up with a family history of neurological illness, which made me familiar with nerves not functioning properly. This familiarity made GCSE biology and psychology feel familiar to me.\n\nI am acutely aware of the brevity of life, which is why I take risks and try new things. I have done parachute jumps and solo paragliding in Nepal because I want to experience all that life has to offer. I want the same for my patients, to help them heal from pain and move on from what is ended, while also encouraging them to see the opportunities in the present moment and to find joy in life.\n\nI had a chance to apply to study at Oxford University, but I was afraid I wouldn't fit in, so I didn't pursue it. Now, I regret not taking that opportunity. As a trainee psychologist, I initially fell into the trap of psychoanalyzing everyone and imposing concepts and theories on situations. However, I came to realize that attending a few lectures didn't make me an expert. I apologize for being insufferable during that phase.\n\nDespite our belief in our individuality and intelligence, humans are fairly predictable. I appreciate honesty in others and dislike being treated like a fool. I think honesty reflects strength, and I value the truth.\n\nPatients often expect me to be friendly and passive, but I believe therapy should be challenging. It should make individuals think not just about what has happened to them, but also their own actions towards themselves and others. Good mental health requires a well-functioning brain, which in turn depends on good nutrition. I often recommend eating more beans for mental well-being.\n\nI don't receive much advice, probably because I come across as a know-it-all. However, I do appreciate feedback. I once learned from someone that I always have my shoulders up and a manicurist even told me that I don't know how to relax. These comments helped me realize how tightly wound I was.\n\nI have joined various committees and boards, often because I noticed a lack of black individuals in those spaces. There is a significant disparity between black people as users of mental health services and their representation as providers. This needs to change urgently.\n\nLastly, I find happiness in lying in the sun, foraging for elderflowers, making pickles, dancing, and singing in a choir. I believe everyone should find the activities that bring them joy and engage in them as much as possible.\n\nKimberley Wilson's book, \"Unprocessed,\" is available for purchase.","createdAt":"2023-11-18T14:00:23Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3825573/pexels-photo-3825573.jpeg"},{"title":"SpaceX’s Starship reaches space for first time but explodes moments later","topic":"science","author":"Huebert World","body":"SpaceX's unmanned Starship spacecraft, designed to transport astronauts to the moon and beyond, reached space for the first time on Saturday.

They found that the country’s only known vulture, Cryptogyps lacertosus, was more primitive than previously thought and lacked the ability to soar like modern vultures. The researchers also found a new species of eagle, Dynatoaetus pachyosteus, which lived up to 500,000 years ago and was second in size only to Dynatoaetus gaffae, the largest eagle on the continent. The vulture weighed approximately 6kg, while the eagle could have weighed up to 12kg. The team’s findings have been depicted in a painting by natural historian and artist John Barrie, showing the birds of prey feasting on a giant wombat-like creature alongside other animals of the time.\n","createdAt":"2023-11-16T14:00:16Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3825368/pexels-photo-3825368.jpeg"},{"title":"Planet where it rains sand revealed by Nasa telescope","topic":"science","author":"Antonella Traversaro","body":"NASA's James Webb space telescope has made groundbreaking observations of a planet called Wasp-107b, located 200 light years away in the Virgo constellation. Astronomers were already intrigued by the planet because of its large size and lightness, leading to its nickname, the \"candy floss\" planet. The latest observations have provided unprecedented insight into this exotic world outside our solar system, revealing the presence of silicate sand clouds and rain, scorching temperatures, strong winds, and the distinctive smell of sulphur dioxide. The study's lead author, Prof Leen Decin, explained that our understanding of other planets is limited since it is based on our knowledge of Earth. Wasp-107b was first discovered in 2017 when astronomers noticed periodic flickering of light from its host star as the planet passed in front of it. The James Webb telescope takes these findings to the next level by examining starlight that passes through the planet's atmosphere, indicating the presence of different gases based on the wavelengths of absorbed light. Wasp-107b has a similar mass to Neptune but is the size of Jupiter, allowing the James Webb telescope to study its atmosphere in greater detail. The initial findings published in Nature indicate the presence of water vapor, sulphur dioxide, and silicate sand clouds on the planet. The atmosphere of Wasp-107b is analogized to Earth's water cycle, but instead of water, it involves the cycling of sand between solid and gaseous states. From the hotter, lower levels of the atmosphere, the silicate vapor rises, cools, and condenses into microscopic sand grains that eventually rain back down. The sand then sublimes back into vapor below a certain altitude, completing the cycle. Researchers noted that the clouds would appear hazy and dusty, and the sand particles would move at high speeds. While Wasp-107b is not considered a candidate for hosting life due to its extreme conditions, the James Webb telescope aims to analyze the atmospheres of other distant planets and search for gases that could indicate the presence of life. Examining the atmospheres of rocky, Earth-sized planets will be more challenging but is seen as a promising endeavor. Overall, these findings remind scientists to broaden their understanding and consider alternative ways for life to form on other planets.","createdAt":"2023-11-15T16:22:23Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1138746/pexels-photo-1138746.jpeg"},{"title":"Plantwatch: restored ghost ponds bring seeds back to life","topic":"science","author":"George Becker","body":"In the past, ponds on farms were abundant and supported a variety of plants and wildlife. However, many of these ponds were drained and filled in to make way for intensive farming, causing them to be forgotten and lost. Nevertheless, these \"ghost ponds\" can be restored, and the seeds of plants that were buried in the sediment can be revived after decades or even centuries of lying dormant under fields of crops.\n\nThere are various ways to identify these ghost ponds, such as by observing damp depressions on the ground, noticing poor crop growth, or referring to old maps. University College London (UCL) has conducted research showing that these ponds can be brought back to life by excavating them to reveal the original pond bed and allowing rainwater or groundwater to fill them up again. When exposed to light and oxygen, the seeds that were preserved in the old sediment can germinate, resulting in the return of plant life and aquatic animals in less than a year.\n\nThe restoration of these ghost ponds has also led to the revival of rare plants that were considered extinct in many regions. One example is the grass-poly, which had not been seen in Norfolk for over a century. In 2020, Professor Carl Sayer from UCL discovered the plant's beautiful pinkish flowers growing in a newly restored pond.","createdAt":"2023-11-15T06:00:00Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/125576/pexels-photo-125576.jpeg"},{"title":"Magicians less prone to mental disorders than other artists, finds research","topic":"science","author":"Edward Jenner","body":"A recent study conducted by Aberystwyth University's psychology department has found that magicians are less likely to experience mental health issues compared to other creative individuals and the general population. The research measured the psychopathological traits of nearly 200 magicians and compared the results to data from other artistic groups and the general population. The study discovered that magicians scored significantly lower in terms of unusual experiences and cognitive disorganisation. This study is the first to demonstrate a creative group with lower scores on psychotic traits than the general population, indicating that the association between creativity and psychopathology is more complex than previously thought. The research suggests that magicians may have lower levels of impulsive nonconformity, a trait associated with antisocial behavior and lower self-control. Magicians were recruited for the study with the help of various magic organizations around the world. The researchers believe that magicians may be more balanced due to their involvement in magic from a young age as a means of overcoming social deficits. Magic provides these individuals with positive social status, attention, confidence, and helps them build social skills. The study suggests that the mental health profiles of magicians are similar to those of mathematicians and scientists. Precision and collaboration are seen as important aspects of magic, and the magician community is noted for its supportive nature and willingness to share ideas and techniques.","createdAt":"2023-11-15T05:00:07Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/4033151/pexels-photo-4033151.jpeg"},{"title":"Did you solve it?

This can be understood by imagining placing two random points (cloves) on the surface of the sphere (orange), and then cutting the sphere in half through these two points. This will result in two hemispheres, both of which include the two points. The third random point (or clove) will be on one of these hemispheres.\n\nProblem 2: If you multiply all the prime numbers less than one million together, the final digit of the answer will be 0. To understand this, consider that when multiplying the prime numbers together, the number 10 is included as a factor (since 2 multiplied by 5 equals 10). Any number that is a multiple of 10 ends in 0.\n\nProblem 3: It is possible to make 20 using three threes and any mathematical operations. One possible solution is: 20 = (3 + 3) / 0.3. The trick is to use a decimal point.\n\nProblem 4: To cut the given figure into four pieces that can be reassembled to form a square, the length of a line in the diagram that is √20 must be found. Using Pythagoras's Theorem for right-angled triangles, it can be determined that the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with short sides 2 and 4 will provide the required length. By cutting at 90 degrees at points P and Q, a square can be formed.\n\nProblem 5: The equation can be made valid by moving exactly two matchsticks.

The inquiry will specifically focus on TikTok's use of marketing pixels to track online behaviour, including shopping habits, website visits, and personal information such as email addresses and phone numbers. Liberal senator James Paterson, who has been vocal about his concerns regarding TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, alleged that the social media platform is using pixels to collect information from non-TikTok users. As part of the inquiry, the OAIC will assess whether TikTok has violated any Australian privacy laws. The platform's spokesperson stated that the use of marketing pixels is compliant with current Australian regulations and dismisses any suggestion otherwise. The OAIC inquiry will serve as a precursor to determine if a formal investigation is necessary. Attorney general Mark Dreyfus stated that TikTok should be transparent and cooperative with the privacy commissioner's inquiries. Paterson has been campaigning for TikTok to be treated as a \"serious national security threat\" due to alleged misconduct, including spying on journalists, suppressing content critical of the Chinese Communist Party, and misleading the public about the company's ties to the Chinese government. TikTok has faced fines and bans in other countries, including the recent €345m ($560m) fine in the EU for violating children's data protection laws and a £12.7m ($24m) fine in the UK for unlawfully processing the data of over 1.4 million children under the age of 13.

Although they are readily available, I have only ever seen one in operation, about six years ago on the A55. I was on my motorbike when a black Range Rover ahead of me signaled to move into my lane. I slowed down and nodded my helmet to let them know it was okay. To my surprise, the LED sign in the back window flashed a cheery THANK YOU. It was a sweet moment, but I felt a bit bad because I had no way of responding when I overtook them. It felt impolite not to say NOT AT ALL! But on a motorbike, it's difficult to physically communicate that. I did my best with a random head movement and a slightly raised thumb. Overall, it was a satisfying exchange.\nRiding a motorbike gives me a lot of thinking time, so I started wondering what the LED sign might have flashed if I hadn't let the car in front of me. I thought of THANKS FOR NOTHING or maybe a simple FUCK YOU. Inter-vehicle communication hasn't really progressed since the invention of the indicator. Drivers are limited to a range of hand signals, more of which convey anger rather than gratitude. To express rage, you can use one finger or two. There's also tapping a loosely clenched fist against your forehead, which is often referred to as the dickhead signal, or the wanker sign. I wonder if this is a British thing, as I remember seeing a strange incident involving Maradona and the lack of this gesture in Spain.\nTo express gratitude, the only real option is to show the palm of your hand, although if you're really cool, you can lift a finger off the steering wheel. It would be liberating to have an LED sign to do the talking for you. The one I'm considering has the ability to display nine messages. Since it's the holiday season, I'll stick to pleasant messages such as THANK YOU, DON'T MENTION IT, YOU'RE WELCOME, MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY NEW YEAR, MY SCIATICA IS GIVING ME HELL, I'M ON A ROAD TO NOWHERE, I GOT THIS FROM SANTA, and I'M SORRY IF THIS IS ILLEGAL.\nI've checked if these signs are legal and the information I found was inconclusive. They may or may not be legal, or maybe they are as long as they don't flash or move. Regardless, I'll just attach it to my belt and use it around the house. After all, if you can't have some fun during the holidays, when can you?

It's the end of the year, which means Amazon has released the most frequently asked questions to Alexa in 2023.\n\nWhat were the top questions? There were so many that they were categorized, including a \"top height questions\" category.\n\nAlright, what was the most asked height question? \"Alexa, how tall is Lionel Messi?\"\n\nAnd what did Alexa say? According to Alexa, Lionel Messi is 5ft 7in (1.7 meters) tall.\n\nThat sounds less exciting than I anticipated. There is also a special category for \"surprising requests\".\n\nGo ahead, surprise me. The top surprising request was \"Alexa, insult me.\"\n\nMore proof that the UK's collective breakdown continues. Following that was \"Alexa, how old are you?\" and \"Alexa, will you marry me?\"\n\nWhy would you ask a virtual assistant to insult you? Probably because Alexa has a variety of comebacks and insults, and people find them entertaining.\n\nCan you give an example of Alexa's witty insults? \"You always exceed expectations...of how annoying you can be\" is one of them.\n\nNot the most impressive AI. Another one is \"Thanks for chatting with me. I needed a good nap.\"\n\nAlexa should stick to her day job.

How about I tell you number nine instead? \"Alexa, fart 17 times in a row.\"\n\nI have a feeling I'll regret asking, but what happens when you do that? Alexa activates a \"skill\" called \"big fart\" which plays a series of fart noises.\n\nA skill? Those are additional applications created by third-party developers to enhance Alexa's capabilities.\n\nSo this one is just a collection of fart noises on demand? It doesn't give me much confidence in the future survival of civilization, does it?\n\nMeryem Tom, Alexa's UK and Ireland manager, says the most asked questions show how customers in the UK use Alexa for learning, help, or quick entertainment.\n\nI'm feeling pretty down now.

While this may seem like an unusual move, it is important for regulators to seek clarity in the AI market. OpenAI is a leading player in the industry, and if established tech companies have already dominated the market before it truly begins, it could hinder competition. The CMA is not the only regulator concerned about the issue; the Federal Trade Commission in the US and German regulators have also explored Microsoft's influence over OpenAI. The recent upheaval at OpenAI, including the firing and rehiring of CEO Sam Altman, has brought the governance arrangements under scrutiny in terms of OpenAI's independence from Microsoft. Microsoft argues that its involvement is not an acquisition and that it merely has a non-voting observer on OpenAI's board. The CMA's current move is minor, as it is only seeking views on whether recent developments constitute a relevant merger situation. While remedies may be challenging without the involvement of US counterparts, it is positive that the CMA is taking this issue seriously as competition in the AI market is crucial.","createdAt":"2023-12-08T17:25:47Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/2566581/pexels-photo-2566581.jpeg"},{"title":"VR goggles for mice create immersive scenarios for brain research","topic":"technology","author":"ThisIsEngineering","body":"Scientists have developed virtual reality goggles for mice that can transport them to different scenarios, from navigating mazes to experiencing the threat of predators.

Instagram will not initially be included in the encryption change, while WhatsApp conversations are already encrypted. The issue of encryption has also arisen in the UK's Online Safety Act, with messaging services potentially having to use accredited technology to detect and remove child sexual abuse material.

According to Donovan, her funding was cut off, she was unable to hire assistants, and she became the target of a smear campaign by Harvard employees. She claims that her right to free speech was violated. These claims arose partly from Donovan's publication of the Facebook papers, a leak of internal documents from the company. Donovan believed the papers were of public interest and began publishing them on Harvard's website. She alleges that she was treated differently by the university from that point forward, leading to the loss of her job. In a meeting between the dean's council and the former Facebook communications head, Elliot Schrage argued against Facebook being the arbiter of truth. Shortly after this meeting, the dean emailed Donovan questioning her approach to studying misinformation when there is no independent arbiter of truth. Donovan has filed a complaint reproducing this email and highlighting Zuckerberg's use of the term \"arbiter of truth.\" Donovan claims that her main project was phased out last year and her position was eliminated this year. However, the Harvard Kennedy School denies that Donovan's departure was related to Meta. The school claims that it struggled to find a faculty sponsor for Donovan and offered her the chance to continue as a part-time adjunct lecturer, which she declined. Donovan is known for her testimony before Congress and public speaking on the financial benefits that tech companies gain from the spread of misinformation.

The decision comes as the company faces pressure from an activist investor. Daniel Ek, Spotify's CEO, announced that the company would be cutting 17% of its workforce, marking its third and most substantial round of redundancies this year. Other major tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, have also made large-scale redundancies in response to rising interest rates and investor focus on cost-cutting. Despite being the dominant player in global music streaming, Spotify has scaled back its investment in podcasting amid sluggish economic momentum. The company has maintained valuable podcasting partnerships, including controversial deals with Joe Rogan, Emma Chamberlain, and Trevor Noah. Additionally, in October, Spotify announced plans to offer up to 15 hours of audiobooks per month, increasing potential revenue streams while competing with Amazon-owned Audible. Ek stated that Spotify had taken advantage of low borrowing costs in 2020 and 2021 but now finds itself in a different environment. The company's costs remain too high for its desired structure despite efforts to reduce expenses. Swedish-based Spotify, valued at over $35 billion on the NYSE, has attracted attention from activist investor ValueAct, which holds a $220 million stake. ValueAct's CEO, Mason Morfit, criticized Spotify's spending, claiming it had \"exploded\" and was \"built for the bubble.\" While this spending has helped attract customers, Spotify raised its prices in July to capitalize on increased subscribers. The price increase resulted in a €65 million profit and €3.4 billion in revenue for the third quarter of 2023. Spotify's share price increased by 7% in pre-market trading, reaching over $180. While the company's market value has doubled this year, it remains below its 2022 starting level and its record high of over $360 in February 2021, when pandemic-induced rate cuts surged tech companies. Spotify employed 9,400 people at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and had already reduced employee numbers by 6% in January and an additional 2% in June. Redundant employees will receive an average of five months of severance pay plus unused holiday pay.

The complaint is a part of a lawsuit filed by the attorneys general of 33 states against Meta, and it claims that the company knew about numerous complaints regarding underage users but failed to disclose this information. According to the complaint, Meta only disabled a fraction of the accounts reported to be underage. Internal company documents cited in the complaint suggest that the large number of underage users was well-known within the company. The complaint also accuses Meta of violating the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act, which requires parental consent before collecting data from children. The lawsuit also addresses allegations that Meta deliberately created products that were addictive and harmful to children. In particular, whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed that internal studies showed that Instagram led children to anorexia-related content, and the lawsuit highlights several Meta officials acknowledging that the company designed its products to exploit the vulnerabilities of young minds. In response, Meta stated that the complaint misrepresents its efforts to ensure the safety of teenage users and claimed to have numerous tools to support both teenagers and their parents. However, Meta argued that age verification is a complex challenge and suggested shifting the responsibility of monitoring underage usage to app stores and parents.

One possibility is that the disagreement stemmed from Altman's involvement in other business ventures, which could have led to concerns about his commitment to OpenAI.

The governance arrangements of OpenAI were always going to be challenging, particularly with a major investment from Microsoft. Protecting their investment and retaining valuable employees would naturally be a priority. However, the exact reason for Altman's firing still matters, and the remaining board members, particularly the two departed women, Tasha McCauley and Helen Toner, should provide some clarity on the situation. The lack of explanation from OpenAI is disconcerting, especially considering the risks associated with AI technology. In fact, Reuters recently reported that researchers at OpenAI had expressed concerns about the dangers of their latest AI model and had written to the board. The board members need to address these concerns and provide the necessary explanations to regain trust and ensure the responsible development of AI technology.","createdAt":"2023-11-23T18:12:09Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/123335/pexels-photo-123335.jpeg"},{"title":"OpenAI staff: share your view on developments at the company","topic":"technology","author":"fauxels","body":"In light of recent events at OpenAI, we are seeking input from employees at the company.

Well, that depends on which search engine you ask …","topic":"technology","author":"Nao Triponez","body":"On Wednesday, some Bing search engine users reported that when they searched for \"does Australia exist,\" the search results stated that Australia does not exist. This resulted in confusion and discussions among users, with some speculating that Bing was promoting conspiracy theories. However, other users were able to find search results confirming the existence of Australia. It was also noted that the result only appeared in regular searches and not in conversational searches using Microsoft's AI. Bing's AI confirmed that Australia is a real country and debunked the conspiracy theories. Microsoft addressed the issue and stated that it had been rectified. They also thanked users for bringing it to their attention. Guardian Australia was unable to replicate the result on Thursday. The conspiracy theories suggesting that Australia is not real have been circulating since 2017 and claim that the country was invented by the British government as a way to execute prisoners. However, these theories have been debunked by scientific evidence.","createdAt":"2023-11-23T02:49:12Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/129208/pexels-photo-129208.jpeg"},{"title":"Judge finds ‘reasonable evidence’ Tesla knew self-driving tech was defective","topic":"technology","author":"Pixabay","body":"A judge in Florida has ruled that there is \"reasonable evidence\" that Elon Musk and other Tesla executives were aware of defects in the company's self-driving technology but allowed the cars to be driven in an unsafe manner regardless. The ruling clears the way for a lawsuit over a fatal crash in 2019 involving a Tesla Model 3. The lawsuit accuses Tesla of intentional misconduct and gross negligence, which could result in punitive damages. The judge also found that the plaintiff should be able to argue that Tesla's warnings were insufficient. The ruling highlights potential inconsistencies between Tesla's internal knowledge and its marketing claims.","createdAt":"2023-11-22T14:13:25Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/33153/raisting-sattelit-reception-signal.jpg"},{"title":"Personal data stolen in British Library cyber-attack appears for sale online","topic":"technology","author":"Pixabay","body":"The British Library has confirmed that personal data stolen in a cyber attack has been discovered online, where it appears to be available for purchase.

Dyson argues that the article's headline, which referred to \"cheats\" prospering, and its inclusion of a \"rogues' gallery\" of individuals, including Dyson himself, were damaging to his reputation.

OpenAI's investors, including Microsoft, are pushing for Altman's reinstatement. Negotiations for his return are currently taking place, with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella mediating discussions. Altman's potential return follows the departures of several senior colleagues from OpenAI. Altman has expressed his affection for the OpenAI team, and it is reported that he is considering a return to the company but with certain conditions regarding a new board and governance structure. Additionally, Altman has been in discussions with Jony Ive regarding the development of a new AI hardware device, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has also been involved in the conversation. Microsoft and Thrive Capital support Altman's reinstatement, while Khosla Ventures wants him back at OpenAI but will support him in his future endeavors. Altman's termination was due to a breakdown in communication rather than misconduct.","createdAt":"2023-11-19T22:16:59Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/3082341/pexels-photo-3082341.jpeg"},{"title":"Elon Musk to file ‘thermonuclear lawsuit’ as advertisers desert X","topic":"technology","author":"David Bares","body":"Elon Musk has announced that he plans to file a lawsuit against Media Matters and others after major US companies suspended their advertisements on his social media platform due to concerns about antisemitism. Media Matters recently reported finding corporate ads from IBM, Apple, Oracle, and Comcast’s Xfinity placed alongside content that praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. As a result, several prominent tech and media companies, including Warner Brothers, Paramount, and Disney, decided to withdraw their advertising. Musk took to his social media platform, previously known as Twitter and now called X, to state that he will be filing a lawsuit against Media Matters and all parties involved in what he called a fraudulent attack on his company. Musk also agreed with a post that falsely claimed Jewish people were inciting hatred against white people, stating that the user was speaking the \"actual truth.\" In a statement, Musk defended X's commitment to free speech and criticized Media Matters for misrepresenting the platform's content and misleading advertisers. He did not address the controversy surrounding his own tweet and has previously denied being antisemitic. Apple was one of X's largest advertisers, spending up to $100 million a year as of November 2022. However, since Musk acquired the platform, there has been a decline in advertisers and user numbers, despite the introduction of a paid premium system. The White House condemned Musk's tweet, calling it a promotion of antisemitic and racist hate that goes against American values. The statement also referenced the recent attacks by Hamas against Israel, stating that it is unacceptable to perpetuate lies about Jewish people.","createdAt":"2023-11-18T10:29:41Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/424436/pexels-photo-424436.jpeg"},{"title":"Apple, Disney and IBM to pause ads on X after antisemitic Elon Musk tweet","topic":"technology","author":"Sebastian Voortman","body":"Apple has decided to pause all advertising on Twitter, which is now called X, after the platform's owner, Elon Musk, tweeted support for an antisemitic post. Several other major technology and media companies, including IBM and Disney, also announced similar actions in response to the incident. Prior to this, Apple's ads had been running alongside tweets praising Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Lionsgate, Warner Bros, Paramount, Sony Pictures, and Comcast/NBCUniversal have also decided to pause their ads on X. IBM had already made this decision the previous night, while Disney was reported to be joining the boycott as well. Musk's tweet accusing Jews of hating white people received criticism from the White House and a coalition of over 150 rabbis, who called for companies like Apple and Disney to stop advertising on the platform. Apple, one of the largest advertisers on X, had significantly decreased its ad spending on the platform since Musk's acquisition in November 2022, but Twitter has still faced challenges with declining user numbers, regulators' scrutiny, and an increase in antisemitic and racist posts. Musk and Apple had a public dispute in December 2022 when Apple reduced its advertising, but a meeting between Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook seemed to resolve the issue. IBM, another major advertiser on X, also stopped advertising on the platform in response to a report that found its ads running alongside hate speech.","createdAt":"2023-11-18T01:47:52Z","votes":0,"article_img_url":"https://images.pexels.com/photos/166055/pexels-photo-166055.jpeg"}]
